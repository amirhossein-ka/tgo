# TGO Routers

## ToDo:

write a nice documentation about what they are, how they works, and how to implement one ourselves!

<!-- As you've read from the beginning, Tgo gives you the ability to implement your own routers!

All routers implements the [Router](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/haashemi/tgo#Router) interface, and they can be added to bot using [bot.AddRouter](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/haashemi/tgo#Bot.AddRouter) in the order you want or need.

Currently at `v0.1`, there are three built-in routers you can use. message, callback, and raw routers. You can read more about them [here](/routers/).

**Note: Ask method has the highest priority than all of the routers.** -->
