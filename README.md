# TGO: Golang Telegram Bot Framework

TGO is a simple and fully flexible telegram bot framework.

You can implement your filters and routers however you want to match your requirements.

All API methods and types are all code generated from the [telegram's documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) in `./cmd` to `api.gen.go` file.

The rest of this package is a wrapper around the generated code to improve the developer experience and make it more flexible.

## ToDo:

- write a nice README / documentation...
