# TGO: Golang Telegram Bot Framework

TGo is gonna be an easy-to-use telegram bot _framework_.

All [bot-api](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) methods, types, and interfaces are autogenerated in `cmd` to `api.gen.go` file.

The rest of this package is a wrapper around the generated code to improve the developer experience and make it way easier to use.

## Roadmap

- [x] in-context storage
- [ ] handle every single api errors
- [ ] pre-made filters (more, much more...)
- [ ] pre-made middlewares
- [ ] pre-made routers
- [x] better file structure
- [ ] logger on \*Bot
- [x] api client optimizations
- [ ] more examples
